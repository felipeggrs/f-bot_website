# F-Bot website

This is a website created for the F-Bot software made by Darcio. This is a completely free project that I'll be using to improve my web development skills.

So, this one was interesting. I learned a lot about Flexbox in the past week or so, and have been learning basic CSS properties before that. I think I've come a long way since the last project (Odin Recipes).

I actually really enjoy fumbling around with Flexbox, although at times it can be a bit challenging figuring out some quirks or whatever. I've also seen Grid mentioned a lot throughout this whole process, but haven't come in contact with it so far. Maybe it'd be worthy pursuing, but I'm not going to focus on that right now. Onwards to Javascript!

Also, and now more specifically to this project, I need to create some drop down menus. Searching online I found out that it COULD be done with pure CSS, but that doing it with JS is more efficient and works better with accessibility, which is always good, right? Maybe there'd be a point in doing it with CSS right now, but I really want to move on to JS, so...
